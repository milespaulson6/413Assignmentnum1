        <p>I am very excited to take this class and be able to add to my arsenal of coding skill, I feel as though i have been able to learn a lot of skills 
        up to this point and want to implement MVC and ASP.net into my repetoire of skills. I also am hyped to do more Javascript cause I really enjoyed learning it in 
        IS 303. I would be way down to do some python again cause I also really enjoyed learning and applying python django into building a website but I suppose we will see
        what happens this semsester!</p>
